* We will use gitlab issue tracker for task and issue tracking.
* Coding jams will be held when necessary.

## Implementation of features

The project is implemented with Django framework, using wide variety of built-in Django features.
Back-end and front-end will be implemented as separate Django apps.
Back-end will have the database, exposed through a RESTful API.
Front-end will have the views and static files required for the user interfaces.

* Back-end
    * Database: sqlite3 for local testing (ease of use), postgre for Heroku (as per Heroku recommendation)
    * Django Models: User, UserGames, Game, GameScore, GameSave (self explanatory)
    * Django Views: There will be RESTful API endpoints at least for all listed models, perhaps more.
    * Django Tests: Tests for REST endpoints will be written here.

* Front-end
    * Views
        * Index (frontpage, maybe popular games highlighted)
        * Game list (with filter/search options)
