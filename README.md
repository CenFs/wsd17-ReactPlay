## Project execution
* We will use wechat & whatsapp for communication.
* Normally, everyone is assigned her/his own tasks, and coding seperately.

* Coding jams will be held when necessary.

## List of features
* Back-end
    * RESTful APIs
    * Database (sqlite/mongodb/mysql/Postgres(highly recommanded by Heroku) ...)

## Implementation of features
* Back-end
    * Database (mysql sqlite or mongodb, why? nosql support unstructured record, the state of games can be quite different from each other
    ,so using relational database can be hard)
        * tables or collections design
    * Django urls.py (API format)
    * Django views.py (How many views do we need? explain each one, related with which url? what it will reponse)
    * Django models (Which models do we need? What is each one's relation with views)
        * User (id, name, password, email, role:"Player/Developer", money)
        * Game (id, name, url, price, developers:[array], Players[{user.id,savedState:{},highestScore},{}...])
        * Playrecord (id, gid[ref Game.id], uid[ref User.id], )

* Front-end
    * Redux
